This project addresses the high-risk nature of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending by developing a robust machine learning model to detect potential defaulters on the Lending Club platform. The primary goal is to help investors and lending companies mitigate substantial financial losses by accurately classifying high-risk applicants. Following the methodology by Mauritsius et al. (2019), our model utilizes tree-based algorithms (Random Forest and LightGBM) to prioritize maximum recall for the defaulter class, as rejecting a legitimate customer is preferred over accepting a high-risk one.
